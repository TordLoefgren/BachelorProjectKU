## Project Briefing

##### Meeting Date: 1 / 4 - 2025


#### What I have done since last meeting
Work and exams.


Report:

- Written a few paragraphs in the project report. Regrettably, nothing major has been done.


Code:
- The coding project is at the moment at a standstill. It pretty much works as a demo for encoding and decoding data with QR codes.
The next step will be to decide what the next priority will be. It could be UI, performance, more tests, etc. 
The buttom line will be that right now, the work done in the project report will help inform me what the next steps should be.




#### What I going to do before the next meeting

- Write minimum 2 pages in the project report. Focus on Background and Implementation sections.
- Focus on creating a red thread for the project structure, and refine the actual project goals.
- Consider what the next steps in the coding project will be (use the report writing to help guide this decision).




Thoughts for future tasks:
- Refactor unit tests and create more test cases, using different configurations. Consider refactoring functions if unit tests reveal unnecessary dependencies. 
- Consider how to prepare the data in such a way that it is S3 or FTP compliant.
- Consider using [Cython](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html) to compile the code. This could potentially provide a significant speedup.
