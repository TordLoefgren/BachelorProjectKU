## Project Briefing

##### Meeting Date: 11 / 3 - 2025

#### Last weeks goals

- Think less, write more. <span style="color:green;">&#x2714; Yes. Better.</span> 
- Take a closer look at S3 and FTP. Maybe include information as section in report. <span style="color:orange;">&#x26A0; Cursory look.</span>
- Write enough in the report that a first read-through is ready. This will be the main goal and focus for the next week. <span style="color:green;">&#x2714; Yes-ish. Introduction + Problem statement.</span> 
- Find solutions to the problem of determining optimal frame size given multiple QR codes in a frame.  <span style="color:orange;">&#x26A0; Deprioritized.</span>
An idea could be to include different modes in the configuration, instead of allowing each individual parameter to be set. <span style="color:orange;">&#x26A0; Deprioritized.</span>
Some parameters already in place does not work well in conjunction. 


#### What I have done since last meeting
Report:
- I have finally gotten some writing done and have set up the initial structure for the report.
- For now the focus has been on getting some words on the page and creating a rough outline for the problem statement and introduction.
- I have prepared sources on visual encoding and QR codes that I will use for the sections on the theory of encoding and QR codes.   
- I have been thinking about expanding the role of programming design in the project, as I feel myself gravitating towards this anyway. I just need to find an angle.

Code:
- Created an option to use a different library for creating QR codes called [segno](https://pypi.org/project/segno/). They seem to have the fastest image generation available for QR codes.
- Implementing a general solution for parallelization of tasks using the [concurrent.futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html) Python package.
This have had a significant improvement on the speed of encoding and decoding. The time it took to encode approx. 10MB worth of QR codes (4291 images) was improved from 481 seconds (7Â½ min.) to 72 seconds (_segno_):

Still very slow, but it is definately a start. 
- Encountered some issues when decoding my QR codes on data that is not just ascii text. It seems that the available Python decoding libraries does not return the raw bytes directly, but rather include an internally encoded version of the data. This is an issue. 
A solution could be to encode the data as _base64_ again, but this would mean that the data will take up even more space. Also, it seems like a patch solution. I will look into options.     

#### What I going to do before the next meeting
Ongoing from previous briefing
- Think less, write more.


New
- Refine and update problem statement. 
- Write theory sections on visual encoding and QR codes. Find out what information is relevant.
- Look into parallelization for video generation.
- Find options on how to solve the issue of QR decoding not returning raw bytes. 


Thoughts for future tasks:
- Refactor unit tests and create more test cases, using different configurations. Consider refactoring functions if unit tests reveal unnecessary dependencies. 
- Consider how to prepare the data in such a way that it is S3 or FTP compliant.
- Consider using [Cython](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html) to compile the code. This could potentially provide a significant speedup.
