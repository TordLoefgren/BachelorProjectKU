## Project Briefing

##### Meeting Date: 15 / 4 - 2025


#### Last weeks goals

- Write minimum 2 pages in the project report. Focus on Background <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span> and Implementation sections. <span style="color:orange;">&#x26A0;</span>  
- Focus on creating a red thread for the project structure, and refine the actual project goals.  <span style="color:green;">&#x2714;</span>
- Consider what the next steps in the coding project will be (use the report writing to help guide this decision). <span style="color:orange;">&#x26A0;</span>  





#### What I have done since last meeting

I have written a bit more in the report and have added to-do's for upcomming writing.




#### What I going to do before the next meeting

- Write minimum 2 pages on the implementation section.
- Start the discussion section and preempt conclusions.





Thoughts for future tasks:
- Refactor unit tests and create more test cases, using different configurations. Consider refactoring functions if unit tests reveal unnecessary dependencies. 
- Consider how to prepare the data in such a way that it is S3 or FTP compliant.
- Consider using [Cython](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html) to compile the code. This could potentially provide a significant speedup.
